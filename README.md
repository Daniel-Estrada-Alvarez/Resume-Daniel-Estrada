## Projects
### Intelligent Water Monitoring System

Designed and engineered an advanced water monitoring system leveraging the cost-effective WiFi ESP32 microcontroller. This comprehensive system integrated an array of peripheral sensors for real-time monitoring of water pressure, turbidity, and temperature as it entered residential properties. To enhance user experience, the system automatically generated daily water reports, promptly delivering them to end-users via both text messages and emails.

Notably, the system featured intelligent valves capable of dynamically redirecting water flow based on turbidity levels, demonstrating its capacity to optimize water distribution and ensure its quality.
